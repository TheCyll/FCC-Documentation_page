             Introduction
         </header>
         <p>Java is a programming language and an informatic platform in sale for the first time in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.</p>
         <p>The purpose of this tutorial is to quick introduce you to the basics of java in a well-knowed first steps called "Hello World". For this we are going to write a short and simple programm to print a text line.</p>

         <header class="title">
             Hello World
         </header>
         <p>The programm will look like this. We will go step by step explaining what does every sentence mean.</p>
         <pre>

            3    public class Welcome1
            4    {
            5     <span class="comment">//the main method starts the app in Java</span>
            6       public static void main( String[] args)
            7       {
            8         System.out.println( "Welcome to Java coding!);
            9       }<span class="comment">//end of main method</span>
            10   }<span class="comment">//end of Welcome1 class</span>
         </pre>
         <p>We'll see how to write this programm in our IDE of preference. For more info about IDE and how to install it visit our <a href="#">IDE and platforms</a> page</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
         <header class="title">
             Comments
         </header>
         <p>Comments are a good practice in coding. They help us to:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Order our ideas</li>
             <li>Understand the function of line of code</li>
             <li>Communicate our ideas to other programmers</li>
             <li>Give structure to our programm</li>
         </ul>
         <p>We can put comments in our programm in two ways:</p>
         <code>//this is a comment</code>
         <p>This type of comment is for only 1 line of text. All text int that line is a comment</p>
         <code>/* this is a multi-line comment */</code>
         <p>This other type is for comments in more than one line. For example:</p>
         
         <pre>/*this
is
a multi-line
comment */
         </pre>
         
         
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Class_declaration">
         <header class="title">
             Class declaration
         </header>
         <p>For the start we need to declarate a class. We can see this in line 3 of our code. All programm has a class that you have to define. The 'class' keyword declarates a class and the name of this class must come inmediately</p>
         <p>We can name this class with and identifier. An identifier is a way to write names that have some characteristics.</p>
         <p>In programming we commonly use names for identification of variables that are clear and well notated. We use camel-case, meaning to intercalate Low and upper case like this examples:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>ThisIsCamelCase</li>
             <li>NiceIdentifierName</li>
             <li>VariableSuperDuperTruper</li>
         </ul>
         <p>We can also use numbers in our identifiers. A lot of IDE only support numbers at the end of the identifier, NEVER in the beggining. For example:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>VariableX1</li>
             <li>NameOfTeacher2</li>
             <li>CommonCamelCaseFor4</li>
         </ul>

             <header class="title">
                 Method declaration
             </header>
             <p>The 6 line</p>
             <code>public static void main( String[] args)</code> 
              
             <p>is a method declaration. This is the start point of any Java application. The parenthesis after the 'main' word indicate that this is a construction block of the programm, which is called <span class="bold_text">method</span>. Java declarations often have one or more methods. In a Java application, just one of this methods must be main and it has to be defined as the 6 line. The keyword <span class="bold_text">void</span> means this method won't return any information.
             The words <span class="bold_text">String[] args</span> between parenthesis are a part of the main method declaration. </p>
             <p>The left key in line 7 beggins the <span class="bold_text">body of the method declaration</span>. Its corresponding right key must end it in line 9.</p>
             <code>String []args</code><br>

         <header class="title">
             Output operations
         </header>
         <p>The line 8</p>
         <code>System.out.println( "Welcome to Java coding!);</code>
         <p>tells the computer to make a computation; meaning to print a string of characters in between the double quotes (without include them).</p>
         <p><span class="bold_text">System.out</span> is known as the <span class="bold_text">standard output object</span>. It enables the Java aplications to show information in the comand window.</p>
         <p>The method <span class="bold_text">System.out.println</span> shows (prints) a tex line in the comand window. The string in the parenthesis in line 8 is the <span class="bold_text">argument</span> for the method.</p>
